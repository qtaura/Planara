Immediate High-Impact Items (Missing Today)

Implement org/team/membership models and RBAC guard; migrate User.teamId usage.
Add pagination/filtering to list endpoints (routes/users.ts getUsers, projects, tasks).
Add global error-handling middleware and standardized JSON error shapes.
Build Notification preferences + read/unread + digest job.
Add Socket.IO real-time updates for tasks/comments; presence tracking.
If you want, I can start by drafting the RBAC middleware and the Organization/Team/Membership models, plus migration plan and scaffolding endpoints, then follow with pagination across list routes.
